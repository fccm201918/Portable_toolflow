Requirement to run the tool flow:

1). Python 2.7.5 version
2). Vivado design suite
3). Linux operting system

Steps to run the code:

1). Designs folder contains all intermediate VHDL design files to run through portable tool flow

2). After storing all intermediate VHDL design files in the designs folder run the tool flow (portable.py) file


Intermediate VHDL design file:

1). Here we tried to combine all possible solutions for each design file in a single file. 
As it is known how we write code effcet on the resource utilization of the target FPGA for example  we can write the code 
which consumes the less LUT, or more LUT, More Flipflops or less, More BRAM's or less, More DSP Blocks or less.

Possibly we can alter or write the VHDL code in 8 possible ways according to our requirement (its not good idea to have multiple
files like 8 files for single design, or it is difficult for designer to write or alter exicsting code written by someone else)

To overcome above problem we came up with defining VHDL file in intermediate design file.
# Here user will define all 8 possible design options in a single file, and also designer can define default design (so that when 
user run those files without our tool flow its doesn't effect normal synthesis process)
# To exract hidden options in the design we need to make use of our proposed tool flow.


Tool flow working:
We created folder called "designs"which contains all design files, while running our tool flow it extracts the files avialable
in that folder. 
As I mentioned above while writing Intermediate design file designer set default selection the code for example (more LUT, Less Fliflop
, less DSP, More BRAM's ) design a default.Basically when user runs the intermediate files without our tool flow he get above
optioned bit file.

In our tool flow we have given options to keep some files to default and some files user to selects there choices:
This is  automated part and customized part
Automated part: selected options like (less LUT, More FF, More BRAM, Less DSP) applied all available intermediate files
Coustmized part:Here user define the number of files he like to keep default and to select design options. If we want to keep 
two files to default selection and rest files to make his selection, which he can do using this.
